    }
},
```

```lua
Config.Notify = 'ox' -- 'qb', 'ox', or 'okok'
Config.progressbartype = 'oxbar' -- 'oxbar', 'oxcir', or 'qb'
Config.minigametype = 'ox' -- See Config.Minigames for options

## How to install like a boss

**step 1**

- delete qb-houserobbery

**step 2**

- Open the install folder
- **if** you use ox_inventory upload the items from the oxitems.md

**step 3**

- Modify `ritwik-houserobberies/config.lua` to your liking

<h1>Fivemerr</h1>
This is NOT a requirement but something I personally use and believe in.

- to integrate with fivemerr make sure you have  ``set fivemerrLogs "API_KEY"``   in your server.cfg
- Head to /server/bridge.lua and line 3 turn local logs = true
- profit

Why integrate with Fivemerr? Its a great place to store logs as it doesnt rely on discord webhooks and its far easier to search through

As well as a place to offload images and videos from fivem that doesnt rely on discord since discord API will be automatically deleting images and videos after a certain amount of time If you need an invite to their server look below
