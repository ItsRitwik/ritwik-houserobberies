## Development Process

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ritwik-houserobberies.git
   cd ritwik-houserobberies
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Ensure you have a FiveM development server
   - Install QBCore framework
   - Install ox_lib
   - Install ps-ui (optional but recommended)

3. **Test Environment**
   - Set up a local test server
   - Add the resource to your server
   - Test all functionality before submitting changes

### Code Style Guidelines

#### Lua Conventions
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow existing code patterns in the project

#### File Organization
- Client-side code goes in `client/`
- Server-side code goes in `server/`
- Shared configuration in `config.lua`
- Documentation in root directory

#### Naming Conventions
```lua
-- Variables: camelCase
local playerPed = PlayerPedId()
local cooldownTime = 600

-- Constants: UPPER_CASE
local MAX_LOOT_ITEMS = 6
local DEFAULT_COOLDOWN = 600

-- Functions: camelCase
function checkPlayerCooldown(playerId)
    -- function body
end

-- Events: kebab-case with resource prefix
RegisterNetEvent('ritwik-houserobbery:client:enterHouse')
```

### Commit Guidelines

#### Commit Message Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

#### Type
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

- **test**: Adding missing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

#### Examples
```
feat(cooldown): add Steam ID fallback for cooldown tracking

Add license identifier as fallback when Steam ID is not available.
This ensures cooldown system works in all server configurations.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(loot): resolve variable shadowing in loot spawning

Changed loop iterator from 'k' to 'obj' to prevent overwriting
the object reference during loot spawning process.

Fixes #456
```

### Testing

Before submitting a pull request, please ensure:

1. **Functionality Testing**
   - Test all house tiers (1-4)
   - Test all minigame types
   - Test cooldown system

2. **Edge Case Testing**
   - Test with missing dependencies
   - Test with invalid configurations
   - Test server restart scenarios
   - Test player disconnect/reconnect

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Monitor server performance impact
   - Check for memory leaks
   - Verify network efficiency

### Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Update CHANGELOG.md following the format
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Update configuration examples if needed

## Important Notes

- Always document breaking changes in CHANGELOG.md
- Provide upgrade instructions
- Consider backward compatibility when possible

### Dependencies
- Keep dependencies to a minimum
- Use optional dependencies when possible
- Always check if dependencies exist before using them
